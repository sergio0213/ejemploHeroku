**** Python
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and
integrate systems more effectively.
**** Ruby
Ruby is...
A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity
and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and
easy to write.
**** Clojure
Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java
Virtual Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a
general-purpose language, combining the approachability and
interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and
robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a
compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains
completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at
runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with
optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java
can avoid reflection.
**** F#
F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first
programming language which empowers users and organizations to tackle
complex computing problems with simple, maintainable and robust code.

F# runs on Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Windows as well as HTML5 and
GPUs. F# is free to use and has an OSI-approved open source license.

F# is used in a wide range of application areas and is supported by
both industry-leading companies providing professional tools, and by
an active open community.

The F# Software Foundation exists to promote, protect, and advance F#,
and to support and foster the growth of a diverse international
community of F# users.
**** Haskell.org
Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An
open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge
research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct
software. With strong support for integration with other languages,
built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich
libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce
flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.
**** Scala
Have the best of both worlds. Construct elegant class hierarchies for
maximum code reuse and extensibility, implement their behavior using
higher-order functions. Or anything in-between.

*** Selling points
- I like python.org's menu which shows Web Programming, GUI
  Development, etc. and then next to each the library one would use
  to accomplish that task.
- Linux, OS X, Windows.
