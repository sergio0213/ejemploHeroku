Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An
open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge
research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct
software. With strong support for integration with other languages,
built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich
libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce
flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.
